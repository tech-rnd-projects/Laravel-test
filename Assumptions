0 static board vs random
in slot Command uncomment

1. issue in payout:
A payline might have multiple matches from different rows, this case is not catered for.
for now just take the biggest match.

2. booard row - payline matches:
if the board row has 'r 1 r k h' and the payline is 'r k h 1 2', 'r' first match is column 1 so its a logical bug.
improvement: second 'r' in row should also be considered. 
Note this is on a single row not like poiint 1 whuich is multiple matches in multiple rows.

3. No max paylines:
a bet might have x amount of paylines, but its always 1 euro. the more paylines, the more winnings :) lol.
for now just hardcoded bet paylines (always the same bet).
